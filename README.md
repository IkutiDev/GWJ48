# GWJ48

This is a repository for a game made for Godot Wild Jam 48.

## Setting

The protagonist is as a knight that nimbly fights off enemies with sword and board.

The game takes place in a medieval city, in the middle on the night.

## Loss condition

The game ends once the player runs out of health.

Health loss occurs through enemy attacks.

## Win condition

The player gains points for defeating enemies, increasing their score, with the end goal of reaching a satisfactory high score.

## Location

The game arena consists of a single level filled with platforms allowing for vertical movement via jumping.

A battle arena from Terraria is a decent approximation of the intended game arena.
